      <p>A beef patty is a delicious and savory Jamaican pastry filled with seasoned ground beef. It's a popular street food and can be enjoyed as a snack or a meal. Here's a recipe to make your own homemade beef patties.</p>
      <h3>Ingredients</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>For the pastry:</li>
        <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1/2 cup cold butter, cut into small cubes</li>
        <li>1/4 cup cold water</li>
        <li>For the beef filling:</li>
        <li>1 pound ground beef</li>
        <li>1 onion, finely chopped</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon curry powder</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon thyme</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon paprika</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper (optional, for heat)</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Instructions</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>In a large mixing bowl, combine the flour and salt for the pastry. Add the cold butter and use your fingers or a pastry cutter to cut the butter into the flour until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs.</li>
        <li>Add the cold water, a little at a time, and mix until the dough comes together. Knead the dough gently on a floured surface until it forms a smooth ball. Wrap the dough in plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>In a skillet, heat the vegetable oil over medium heat. Add the chopped onion and minced garlic and sauté until softened.</li>
        <li>Add the ground beef to the skillet and cook until browned. Break up the beef with a spoon as it cooks.</li>
        <li>Stir in the curry powder, thyme, paprika, cayenne pepper (if using), salt, and pepper. Cook for another 2-3 minutes to allow the flavors to meld. Remove from heat and let the beef filling cool.</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 375°F (190°C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.</li>
        <li>Remove the pastry dough from the refrigerator and roll it out on a floured surface to a thickness of about 1/4 inch.</li>
