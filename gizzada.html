      <h2>Gizzada</h2>
      <img src="images/gizzada.jpg" alt="Gizzada">
      <p>Gizzada, also known as "pinch-me-round" or "gizzarda," is a traditional Jamaican pastry filled with a sweet and spiced coconut filling. It has a crumbly crust and a deliciously aromatic filling that combines coconut, brown sugar, and spices. Gizzadas are a delightful treat enjoyed during holidays and special occasions.</p>
      <h3>Ingredients</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1/2 cup cold butter, cut into small pieces</li>
        <li>1/4 cup granulated sugar</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
        <li>1/2 cup grated coconut</li>
        <li>1/2 cup brown sugar</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons water</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Instructions</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>In a large bowl, combine the flour, granulated sugar, salt, nutmeg, and cinnamon.</li>
        <li>Add the cold butter to the bowl and use your fingertips or a pastry cutter to cut it into the dry ingredients until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs.</li>
        <li>Add water, one tablespoon at a time, and mix until the dough comes together. Do not overmix.</li>
        <li>Divide the dough into small portions and shape each portion into a ball.</li>
        <li>Preheat oven to 350°F (175°C).</li>
        <li>In a separate bowl, combine the grated coconut, brown sugar, and vanilla extract to make the filling.</li>
        <li>Take each dough ball and press it into a greased tart or muffin pan, creating a small pastry shell.</li>
        <li>Spoon the coconut filling into each pastry shell, filling it to the top.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven for about 15-20 minutes or until the pastry turns golden brown.</li>
        <li>Remove from the oven and let the gizzadas cool in the pan for a few minutes.</li>
        <li>Carefully transfer the gizzadas to a wire rack to cool completely before serving.</li>
